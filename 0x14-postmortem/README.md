# 0x11. Postmortem

## Description
A postmortem is a tool widely used in the tech industry. After any outage, the team(s) in charge of the system will write a summary that has 2 main goals:

* To provide the rest of the company's employees easy access to information detailing the cause of the outage. Often outages can have a huge impact on a company, so managers and executives have to understand what happened and how it will impact their work.
* And to ensure that the root cause(s) of the outage has been discovered and that measures are taken to make sure it will be fixed.
