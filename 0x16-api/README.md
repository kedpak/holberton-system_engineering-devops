# API

## Synopsis 
Old school system administrators usually only know Bash and that is what they use to build their scripts. While Bash is perfectly fine for a lot of things, it can quickly get messy and not efficient compared to other programming languages. The new generation of system administrators, usually call SRE, are pretty much regular Software Engineers but instead of building products, they are managing systems. And one of the big difference with their ancestors is that they know more than just Bash scripting.

One popular way to expose an application and dataset is to use an API, often, they are the public facing part of websites and micro-services so that allow outsiders to interact with it, access and modify its data. In this project, you will access employees data via an API to organize then and export them to different data structures.

That is a perfect example of a task that is not suited for Bash scripting, so let's build Python scripts.
